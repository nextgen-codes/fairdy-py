            <h5>Block Cycle Limit</h5>
            <p>
                All new accounts have a <em>Block Cycle Limit</em>, which limits the amount of simulations the account
                can run on a one month rolling basis. Block Cycle Limit is calculated as the size of the storage system (in blocks)
                multiplied by the number of cycles. New accounts have a default Block Cycle Limit of 500 million.
                The default limit allows up to 100 simulations with up to 50,000 total blocks in each system, 100 cycles each.
                <strong>Enter -1 to give a user an unlimited block cycle limit.</strong> This is an integer field with a max. value
                of 2,147,483,647. Enter your choice in millions, it will be automatically multiplied by the web framework.
