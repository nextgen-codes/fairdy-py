                While FaiRDy is a lightweight framework for characterizing the reliability of storage systems
                over their lifecycle, it still requires a certain amount of compute and memory to process the simulations.
                For this reason and because the server is hosted on hardware at the University of Stavanger, new accounts
                have a <em>Block Cycle Limit</em>, which limits the amount of simulations within a month. Block Cycle Limit
                is calculated as the size of the storage system (in blocks) multiplied by the number of cycles. New accounts
                have a default Block Cycle Limit of 500 million, your remaining credits are shown with a progress bar on
                your profile page. Considering that most systems reveal few additional insights after 100 cycles, the default
                limit allows you to run 100 simulations with up to 50,000 total blocks in each system. This should be sufficient
                for most, but please contact us if you would like to request an increase in your limit.
            </p>

            <h5 id="email_validation">Email Validation</h5>
            <p>
                You will not be able to run simulation until you verify your email address by clicking a link we email to you.
                If you have not received a validation email, check your spam folder, or use the links on your profile page to
                send a new confirmation or change your email address. Note that changing your email will require you validate the
                new email address before running any simulations.
            </p>

            <h3 id="delete_account">Delete Account</h3>
            <p>
                If you wish to delete your FaiRDy account we will remove all of your personal information from our database.
                Either follow the link in your profile page, or click <a href="{% url 'accounts:delete' %}">here</a>. The
                simulations you have ran with your account will remain in our database, but they will no longer be associated
                with your former username. You must enter your password to delete your account, if you have forgotten your
                password, first reset your password <a href="{% url 'accounts:forgot_password' %}">here</a>, then follow the
                delete link from your profile page after validating your email.
            </p>

            <h3 id="forgot_password">Forgot Password</h3>
            <p>
                If you have forgotten your password, go to the <a href="{% url 'accounts:forgot_password' %}">forgot password</a>
                page and enter your username. You will receive a validation email, and upon following the link it contains you
                will be able to reset the password for your account.
