            <p>
                In addition to running and storing individual storage system life cycle simulations, you are also able to
                compare the results of several simulations simultaneously and download the raw simulation data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the compare and download features are controlled by the checkboxes and buttons on the main simulation
                index page. Simply check the boxes you wish to compare or download, and click the appropriate button. Your
                selections will be stored as you navigate between different page numbers.

            <p>
                After a simulation is finished processing you will be redirected to a page where you can view the results.
                This page includes a plot of the Block Availability Factor throughout the evolution of your system, as well as
                details of the system itself.

                simulations followed by the "Compare" Button.

                Comparing these two simulations with otherwise identical specifications we see that the lazy heal threshold
                of 16 has a serious negative effect on the evolution of the system over time.

            <h1>Download</h1>
            <p>
                You can download the results of any simulation in a comma separated values (CSV) file to analyze or plot
                the data in software of your choice. The data includes the parameters used to define the storage system and
                simulation, along with 3 pieces of data for each of the simulation's cycles: block availability factor, number
                of blocks faulted this cycle, and number of blocks healed this cycle.
            </p>
