                FaiRDy is a lightweight approach to simulate the failure-repair dynamics of storage systems and explore
                the effects of different redundancy strategies and parameters on system degradation. FaiRDy is based on cellular automata,
                the blocks of storage system data are represented as cells, which can either be available or unavailable. The simulations
                are run in two-part cycles, in the first half of the cycle, cells are randomly marked as unavailable according to the
                specified probability of failure. In the second half of the cycle, the unavailable blocks are repaired
                where possible according to rules of the erasure code.
            </p>
            <p><strong> To evaluate the performance of a storage system over time FaiRDy computes a <em>Block Availability Factor (BAF)</em>
                at the end of every cycle, which is the proportion of blocks in the system which were available at the end of the cycle.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you will find a quick overview of key concepts central to FaiRDy and this website.

            <h3>Cellular Automata</h3>
            <p>
                A cellular automaton (pl. cellular automata, abbrev. CA) is a collection of boolean
                cells, also referred to as blocks in fairdy-py, which together form a system. This system
                is then evolved through a set of discrete time cycles, with the state of a block in a given cycle
                determined by its neighbors' states in the previous cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                In FaiRDy the CA represents a digital storage system, and the individual cells represent
                blocks of data contained within this system. To begin with, all data blocks in the system are considered
                available, however in the first step of each time cycle blocks are randomly marked as unavailable by a fault-
                injection module, using a pre-specified probability of failure, to simulate real world events which lead
                to data loss. In the second step of time cycle, an attempt is made to repair the failures introduced in the
                first step,  whether or not this is successful is determined by a set of rules specific to the erasure code
                being modelled.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h3>Erasure Codes</h3>
            <p>
                An erasure code encodes redundancy into a stream of data, this in turn ensures the
                data is recoverable even if certain blocks in the stream are erased or otherwise unavailable. Optimal
                 erasure codes enable recovery of data up to the point that the number of erased blocks equals the number of
                redundancy blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                In FaiRDy we define a <em>stripe</em> in terms of the dimensions of the erasure code to be investigated. After the
                stripe is defined, a specified amount of stripes are concatenated to form a complete storage system model which is
                then cycled between fault-injection and repair to gain insight into the storage system's properties.
            </p>

            <h4>n-way replication</h4>
            <p>
                N-way replication is the most simple way to store data redundantly, and in FaiRDy a n-way replication
                stripe consists of a single data block, and n complete replicas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repair Rules:<br>
                A n-way replication stripe is considered repairable if at least one copy of the data is not erased.

            <h4>Reed-Solomon codes</h4>
            <p>
                Reed-Solomon codes are optimal erasure codes, and tolerate a number of block erasures equal to the number of
                redundancy blocks in the stripe. In real storage systems the contents of the redundancy blocks are computed
                and decoded using advanced linear algebra, this is however ignored in FaiRDy and a stripe will be repaired
                as long as enough active blocks remain to allow this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repair Rules:<br>
                A Reed-Solomon stripe is considered repairable as long as the number of erased blocks does not exceed
                the number of redundancy blocks.
            </p>

            <h4>Generalized Pyramid codes</h4>
            <p>
                The Generalized Pyramid codes implemented by FaiRDy are composed of up to two different Reed-Solomon stripe shapes,
                one in the vertical direction and one in the horizontal direction. This provides an extra layer of protection since each data block
                is a member of two different Reed-Solomon stripes, with each providing a possibility for repair. Two different
                Generalized Pyramid code stripe constructions are possible in FaiRDy, standard non-overlapping with the blocks
                 arranged in the shape of a hexagon, and an overlapping with the blocks arrange in the shape of a rectangle. The
                overlapping construction adds an additional dimension of redundancy, with the overlapping redundancy blocks computed
                using the vertically redundant as data input blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repair Rules:<br>
                A Generalized Pyramid stripe is considered repairable as long as some combination of
                vertical and horizontal sub-stripes are repairable according to Reed-Solomon rules to restore
                all data blocks.
            </p>

            <hr>
            <h5>non-overlapping</h5>
            <p> The number of horizontal stripes is equal to the number of DATA blocks in the vertical stripes, and correspondingly, the
                number of vertical stripes is equal to the number of DATA blocks in horizontal stripes.

            <hr>
            <h5>overlapping</h5>
            <p>
                The number of horizontal stripes is equal to the TOTAL number of blocks in the vertical stripe, and correspondingly, the
                number of vertical stripes is equal to the TOTAL number of blocks in the horizontal stripe. The overlapping redundancy
                blocks are computed using the vertical redundancy blocks as the input data blocks, and thereby provide second degree
                redundancy.

            <h3>How Simulations Work</h3>
            <p>
                Simulations are carried out in a dedicated Python module that can also be used on the command line to
                simulate the life cycles of storage systems. This module uses numpy arrays to store the state of the individual
                blocks and stripes, and cycles through fault-injection and fault-repair steps to simulate the evolution of the
                storage system.
            </p>
